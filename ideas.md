# RP

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The world does not revolve around the players. The world evolves on itself, the players are just living in that world

New universe, with new people, new religions, new governments,

Multiple continents
Different countries on each continent
Different mechanics for each country

Interval between modern and medieval universe

## Scene idea

The players looking from far away while a nuclear bomb destroys a country, taking millions of souls.

## Mechanic ideas

Magic is really rare
There's a city like Piltover, where magic comes from a big technological advance
Most of the population does not know about magic. The few people who do know about magicians think it comes from another world
There are animal species really close to magic, they have it naturally

**Magic cannot be learned, you are born with it or not**

Eragon-like mind control is a powerful form of magic. A king of one of the countries has a magician under its service and uses him to check the mind of the people coming to him. This gives him a lot of safety.
This king makes the population think he possesses magic, but he does not. The magicians are usually hidden around him, in the shadows.
-> The magicians are at the service of this king because he is extremely powerful. His armies are feared in the entire world, and nobody would dare approach him.
This king is extremely powerful and extremely charismatic. Nobody dears to oppose him.

Another country is at the head of the technology. The scientists over there are about to discover a powerful form of energy that, just like electricity, will give them an immense advantage. It is very quickly developed and used to create trade routes.
The capital of this continent is Piltover. It thus also has an under city, much more crude and violent, that organizes with the law of the strongest. Both societies respect the other, because they both know that war would lead to mutual annihilation.

Conflict between these 2 countries, that could lead to the nuclear war.
-> One country has technology, what does the other one have? Not magic, too rare
