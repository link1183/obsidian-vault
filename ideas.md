# RP

New universe, with new people, new religions, new governments,

Multiple continents
Different countries on each continent
Different mechanics for each country

More modern approach

## Scene idea

The players looking from far away while a nuclear bomb destroys a country, taking millions of souls.

## Mechanic ideas

Magic is really rare
There's a city like Piltover, where magic comes from a breaking technological advance
Most of the population does not know about magic. The few people who do know about magicians think it comes from another world
There are animal species really close to magic, they have it naturally

**Magic cannot be learned, you are born with it or not**
