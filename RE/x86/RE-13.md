# Control registers

The control registers are used to determine the operating mode of the CPU and the characteristics of the current task. There are 5 different control registers :

- **CR0**: System flag controlling the operating mode and various states of the processor.
- **CR1**: Not implemented yet
- **CR3**: Memory page fault information.
- **CR4**: Flags that enable CPU features and indicate feature capabilities of the CPU.

The values in the control registers can't be directly accessed, but can be moved in a GP register where it can then be accessed and changed. To change a control register value, it must be moved from a GP register. Only a program in kernel mode will be able to change the CR values.
Programs may sometimes query the CR to determine the capabilities of the host CPU.
