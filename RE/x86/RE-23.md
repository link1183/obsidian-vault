[[RE-TOC]]

Let's begin by loading the binary in GDB. We can then set a breakpoint on `_start`, and run `disas` to disassemble the program.

```bash
code/x86/23 on  main [!?⇡]
❯ gdb -q moving_immediate_data
Reading symbols from moving_immediate_data...
(No debugging symbols found in moving_immediate_data)
(gdb) b _start
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8049000
(gdb) r
Starting program: /home/agunthe1/projects/github/vaults/personal/RE/code/x86/23/moving_immediate_data

Breakpoint 1, 0x08049000 in _start ()
(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function _start:
=> 0x08049000 <+0>:     nop
End of assembler dump.
```

We coded a `nop`, meaning **no operation**. This is a good practice for debugging purposes.

Running `si` (step into) will step 1 instruction forward.

```bash
(gdb) si
0x08049001 in mov_immediate_data_to_register ()
(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function mov_immediate_data_to_register:
=> 0x08049001 <+0>:     mov    $0x64,%eax
   0x08049006 <+5>:     movb   $0x50,0x804a000
End of assembler dump.
```
