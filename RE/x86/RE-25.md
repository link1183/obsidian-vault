# ASM Program 2 - Moving data between registers

This second program demonstrates how we can move data between registers. Moving data from one register to another is the fastest way to manipulate data. We should always aim to keep data in registers as much as possible.

Specifically, we will move EDX into EAX.

```asm
#moving_data_between_registers: mov data between registers

.section .data

.section .text
  .globl _start

_start:
  nop

  movl $22, %edx

mov_data_between_registers:
  movl %edx, %eax

exit:
  movl $1, %eax
  movl $0, %ebx
  int $0x80
```
