# ASM Program 2 - Moving data between registers

This second program demonstrates how we can move data between registers. Moving data from one register to another is the fastest way to manipulate data. We should always aim to keep data in registers as much as possible.

Specifically, we will move EDX into EAX.

```asm
#moving_data_between_registers: mov data between registers

.section .data

.section .text
  .globl _start

_start:
  nop

  movl $22, %edx

mov_data_between_registers:
  movl %edx, %eax

exit:
  movl $1, %eax
  movl $0, %ebx
  int $0x80
```

It's important to keep in mind we can only move similar registers into each other. Both EAX and EDX are 32-bit registers, and we know that both can be accessed by their 16-bit value as ax and dx respectively. You can't move a 32-bit value into a 16-bit value and vice-versa.

Let's compile it and run it:

```bash
as -32 -o moving_data_between_registers.o moving_data_between_registers.s
ld -m elf_i386 -o moving_data_between_registers moving_data_between_registers.o
./moving_data_between_registers
```
