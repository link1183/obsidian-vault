# Compiling a program

Let's take another look at the program from [[RE-20]], and take a deeper look at how we compiled this program.

```c
int main(void) {
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this program, we simply type:

```bash
gcc -m32 -ggdb -o exit exit.c
```

This single step creates `exit.o`, the binary object file, and `exit`, the executable file.

If we wanted to compile this source C file to Assembly, we'd use the GNU compiler in a similar fashion:

```bash
gcc -S -m32 -O0 exit.c
```

The `-S` flag will create comparable AT&T syntax Assembly source code. The `-m32` will create a 32 bits executable, and the `-O0` will tell the compiler the level of optimisation to use (in our case, none, the most human readable instruction set possible).

This step creates `exit.s`. To then compile it into a binary object file, we use the following command:

```bash
gcc -m32 -c exit.s -o exit.o

```

Finally, we need to use a linker to create the binary executable from the object file, creating an executable called `exit`.

```bash
gcc -m32 exit.o -o exit
```

Let's now dump the executable, in AT&T syntax.

```bash
code/x86/21 on  main [!?⇡] via C v14.2.1-gcc
❯ objdump -d exit | grep main.: -A11

0000116d <main>:
    116d:       55                      push   %ebp
    116e:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
    1170:       e8 0c 00 00 00          call   1181 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax>
    1175:       05 7f 2e 00 00          add    $0x2e7f,%eax
    117a:       b8 00 00 00 00          mov    $0x0,%eax
    117f:       5d                      pop    %ebp
    1180:       c3                      ret
```

Let's examine the code in a debugger. Let's start GDB (the GNU debugger), list the source code, then set a breakpoint on `main`, and run the program. We then disassemble it:

```bash
code/x86/21 on  main [!?⇡] via C v14.2.1-gcc
❯ gdb -q exit
Reading symbols from exit...
(gdb) l
1       int main(void) { return 0; }
(gdb) b main

(gdb) disas
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x5655616d <+0>:     push   %ebp
   0x5655616e <+1>:     mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x56556170 <+3>:     call   0x56556181 <__x86.get_pc_thunk.ax>
   0x56556175 <+8>:     add    $0x2e7f,%eax
=> 0x5655617a <+13>:    mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x5655617f <+18>:    pop    %ebp
   0x56556180 <+19>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

Those 3 above examinations all essentially show the same set of instructions.

The biggest difference between AT&T and Intel syntax is that in AT&T, the source and destinations are reversed compared to Intel.

- AT&T syntax: `movl %esp, %ebp` - Move ESP into EBP
- Intel syntax: `mov esb, ebp` - Move EBP into ESP

If we wanted to create a pure Assembly code program which does the same thing as above, we would type:

```asm
.section .data

.section .bss

.section .text
  .globl _start

_start:
  nop

exit:
  movl $1, %eax
  movl $0, %ebx
  int $0x80
```

To compile this, we would use the GNU assembler and linker:

```bash
as --32 -gstabs -o exit__s.o exit__s.s
ld -m elf_i386 -o exit__s exit__s.o
./exit
```
