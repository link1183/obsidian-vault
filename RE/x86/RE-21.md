# Compiling a program

Let's take another look at the program from [[RE-20]], and take a deeper look at how we compiled this program.

```c
int main(void) {
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this program, we simply type:

```bash
gcc -m32 -ggdb -o exit exit.c
```

This single step creates `exit.o`, the binary object file, and `exit`, the executable file.

If we wanted to compile this source C file to Assembly, we'd use the GNU compiler in a similar fashion:

```bash
gcc -S -m32 -O0 exit.c
```

The `-S` flag will create comparable AT&T syntax Assembly source code. The `-m32` will create a 32 bits executable, and the `-O0` will tell the compiler the level of optimisation to use (in our case, none, the most human readable instruction set possible).

This step creates `exit.s`. To then compile it into a binary object file, we use the following command:

```bash
gcc -m32 -c exit.s -o exit.o

```
