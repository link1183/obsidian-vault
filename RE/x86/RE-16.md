# Heap

The heap is another special area in memory allocated by the CPU for programs. While the stack grows downwards, the heap will grow upwards.

Unlike the stack, the heap is **not** managed automatically by the CPU. It is a free-floating region of memory, much larger than the stack.

To allocate memory on the heap, we use `malloc` and `calloc`, which are built-in C functions. We're then responsible for freeing it by calling `free`.
