# Heap

The heap is another special area in memory allocated by the CPU for programs. While the stack grows downwards, the heap will grow upwards.

Unlike the stack, the heap is **not** managed automatically by the CPU. It is a free-floating region of memory, much larger than the stack.

To allocate memory on the heap, we use `malloc` (memory allocation) and `calloc` (contiguous allocation), which are built-in C functions. We're then responsible for freeing it by calling `free`.

Not freeing the memory will cause a memory leak, meaning that memory on the heap will be left over and won't be available for other programs to use.

The heap does not have variable size restriction, the only limitation it would have is the computer's physical memory size.

Heap is slightly slower to read/write from, as it requires using pointers to access its memory.

Variables created on the heap are also accessible for any functions, they're essentially global variables.

There are a couple of examples where using the heap is better than using the stack, such as:

- Needing to allocate a large array and needing to keep that variable around for a long time.
- Needing variables whose sizes are dynamic, and not known at compile time, or that may grow or shrink during the program.

In all of those cases, you'll need to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` (reallocation) and `free` to manage the memory.
