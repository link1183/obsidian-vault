# General-purpose registers

The general-purpose registers are used to temporarily store data as is it processed by the CPU.

Each new version of general-purpose registers is made with backwards compatibility in mind. This means that 8-bit code meant for an 8080 chip will still function on today's 64-bit chips.

General-purpose registers can be used to store any type of data, but some registers have acquired specific use in programs.

The following 8 registers exist on the x86 32-bit architecture :

- **EAX**: The main register used in arithmetic operations. Also known as accumulator, it holds results of those operations and function return values.
- **EBX**: The base register. It contains a pointer to the base address of the data segment of the program.
- **ECX**: The counter register, often used to hold a value representing the number of times a process needs to repeat. Used for loops and string operations.
- **EDX**: A general purpose register, usually used for I/O operations. Will also extend EAX in a 64-bit architecture.
- **ESI**: Source Index register. It contains a pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS (Data Segment) register. It is used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the address from where to read data.
- **EDI**: Destination Index register. It is a pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the ES (Extra Segment) register. It is used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the implied write address of all string operations.
- **EBP**: Base pointer to the bottom of the current stack frame in the SS (Stack Segment) segment. It is used to reference local variables.
- **ESB**: Stack pointer to the top of the current stack frame. It is used to reference local variables.

All of the above registers are 4 bytes in length. Each of the lower 2 bytes of the EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX registers can be referenced by AX and can be further subdivided in AH, BH, CH and DH for high bytes, and AL, BL, CL and DL for the lower bytes.

ESI, EDI, EBP and ESP can be broken down the following way:

ESI would have SI as its 16 bit segment, EDI would have DI, EBP would have BP, ESP would have SP.
