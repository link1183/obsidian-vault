# ASM program 1 - Moving immediate data

As said before, we're going to make 32 bits programs, as they are most common among malware.

We're now gonna focus on the AT&T syntax.

Every Assembly program is composed of 3 different sections:

1. **Data section**: Used for declaring initialized data or constants. This data does not change at runtime.
2. **BSS section**: Used for declaring uninitialized data or variables.
3. **Text section**: Section with the actual code. It starts with a global `_start`, which is the application's entry point.

The AT&T syntax uses `#` for comments.

The structure of a statement in AT&T Assembly looks like this:

```asm
[label] mnemonic [operands] [comment]
```

A basic instruction has 2 parts. The first one is the name of the instruction (the mnemonic), the 2nd part is the operands (or parameters of the command).
