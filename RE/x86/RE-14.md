# Flags

The topic of flags is one of the most complicated ones when talking about control flow in reverse engineering.

What is important to take away is that flags help control, check and verify the execution of a program, and are a mechanism to determine whether or not an operation was successful.

In a 32 bits architecture, a single 32 bits register contains a group of status, control, and system flags. This register is called the EFLAGS register.

The status flags are as follows :

- **CF**: Carry flag, set when a math operation on an unsigned integer generates a carry or a borrow for the MSB.
