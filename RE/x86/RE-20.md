# Instruction Code Handling

The instruction codes stored in memory each can contain one or more bytes of information that will guide the CPU on how to execute that particular instruction.

Instruction codes are no different from data, when stored in memory. To keep track of the different segment, the CPU uses special pointers, such as the data pointer, or the instruction pointer.

The data pointer (or stack pointer), starts pointing at the bottom of the stack. When new data elements are placed onto the stack, the stack pointer moves downwards, and as data is read from memory, the stack pointer goes upwards.

The instruction pointer is used to help the CPU keep track of which instruction codes have already been executed, and what code is to be processed next.

Each and every instruction code must include an opcode that defines the basic function or task to be performed by the CPU. Opcodes are between 1 and 3 bytes in length, and uniquely define the function that they perform.

Let's examine this simple C program:

```c
int main(void) {
  return 0;
}
```
