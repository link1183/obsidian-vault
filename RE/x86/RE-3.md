# Types of malware

Malware falls into several different categories, described below:

1. A **backdoor** is malicious code that embeds itself into a computer and that allows an attacker with very little privileges to execute various commands on the target machine.
2. A **botnet** gives an attacker access to a system via a command-and-control server which can control an unlimited amount of computers at the same time.
3. A downloader is malicious code that that has for only purpose to download other malicious software. A downloader is frequently installed when a hacker gets an initial access to a system.
4. **Information access malware** gather information from a computer and send it to a **keylogger** or a **password grabber**. They are usually used to gain access to various online ressources which can be sensitive.
5. A **rootkit** hides itself on the user's computer, by for example hiding its IP during an IP scan. They are extremely dangerous because they are very difficult to detect.
6. A **Scareware** is used to trick a user into purchasing additional software to falsely protect the system when there is no real threat that exists.
7. There are other types of malware which sends spam from a target machine, generating income for the attacker.
8. The final form of malware is the traditional worm or virus which copies itself and goes after other machines.
