# ASM Program 1 - Moving data between memory and registers

```bash
#moving_data_between_memory_and_registers: mov data between mem and registers

.section .data
  constant:
    .int 10

.section .text
  .globl _start

_start:
  nop

mov_data_between_memory_and_registers:
  movl constant, %ecx

exit:
  movl $1, %eax
  movl $0, %ebx
  int $0x80
```

This program simply moves a contant int of 10 to ECX.

Let's assemble, link, and run:

```bash
as -32 -o moving_data_between_memory_and_registers.o moving_data_between_memory_and_registers.s
ld -m elf_i386 -o moving_data_between_memory_and_registers moving_data_between_memory_and_registers.o
./moving_data_between_memory_and_registers
```
