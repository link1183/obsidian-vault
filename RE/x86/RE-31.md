# ASM Program 4 - Moving data between registers and memory

```asm
#moving_data_between_registers_and_memory: mov data between regs and memory

.section .data
  constant:
    .int 10

.section .text
  .globl _start

_start:
  nop

mov_immediate_data_between_registers_and_memory:
  movl $777, %eax
  movl %eax, constant

exit:
  movl $1, %eax
  movl $0, %ebx
  int $0x80
```

This program is only for academic purposes, to demonstrate that variables declared in the data section are not constants. In a real world scenario, these variables would be declared under the bss section.

Compiling and running:

```bash
as -32 -g -o moving_data_between_registers_and_memory.o moving_data_between_registers_and_memory.s
ld -m elf_i386 -o moving_data_between_registers_and_memory moving_data_between_registers_and_memory.o
./moving_data_between_registers_and_memory
```
