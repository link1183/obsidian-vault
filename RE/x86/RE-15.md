# Stack

When the execution of a program starts, a contiguous section of memory is allocated, called the stack.

The stack pointer (ESP) is a general-purpose register ([[RE-10]]) that points to the top of the stack. It contains any address such as any address smaller is considered garbage and any greater address is considered valid.

It is important to understand that the stack grows downwards. The "top" of the stack actually points to the lowest stack address in memory, instead of the highest one.

The stack bottom is the largest possible memory address a stack can have.
