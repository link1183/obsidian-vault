# Technological country

Another country is at the head of the technology. The scientists over there are about to discover a powerful form of energy that, just like electricity, will give them an immense advantage. It is very quickly developed and used to create trade routes.
The capital of this continent is Piltover. It thus also has an under city, much more crude and violent, that organizes with the law of the strongest. Both societies respect the other, because they both know that war would lead to mutual annihilation.
